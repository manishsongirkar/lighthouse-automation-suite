- **Core Web Vitals**: Between good and poor thresholds

### 🔴 Poor Performance (Red)
- **Performance Scores**: <50
- **First Contentful Paint**: >3.0s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: >4.0s
- **Total Blocking Time**: >600ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: >0.25
- **Speed Index**: >5.8s

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Modify Delays
Edit `main.py` to adjust delays between requests:
```python
delay = random.randint(5, 10)  # 5-10 second random delay
```

### Change Output Filename
Modify the CSV filename in `main.py`:
```python
write_to_csv(page_speed_scores, "custom_filename.csv")
```

### Screenshot Settings
Enable/disable screenshots in the workflow:
```python
# In run_analysis.py - interactive prompt
📸 Enable Full HD full-page screenshot capture? (Y/n): Y

# Or pass directly to main.py
enable_screenshots = True  # Set to False to disable
```

### Browser Configuration
The tool runs in optimized headless mode by default. To modify browser settings, edit `main.py`:
```python
# Browser is automatically configured for optimal performance
# Headless mode is enabled by default for better performance
options.add_argument("--headless")  # Already enabled for optimization
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ChromeDriver Issues:**
- The tool auto-downloads ChromeDriver
- Ensure Chrome browser is installed
- Try updating Chrome to the latest version

**Timeout Errors:**
- Increase timeout values in `main.py`
- Check internet connection stability
- Some websites may take longer to analyze

**Rate Limiting:**
- Increase delays between requests
- Use proxy rotation for large batches
- Respect Google's terms of service

**Missing Dependencies:**
```bash
# Manual installation of all current dependencies
pip install selenium webdriver-manager fake-useragent pandas openpyxl

# Or re-run the automated setup script
./setup.sh
```

**Screenshot Issues:**
- Ensure sufficient disk space for Full HD screenshots
- Check write permissions in the project directory
- Screenshots require successful Lighthouse analysis completion
- If screenshots fail, analysis will continue normally

**Setup Issues:**
If you encounter any setup problems, try running the automated setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
This will verify your environment and reinstall all dependencies.

## 📋 Best Practices

### For Large URL Lists
- Start with small batches (10-20 URLs)
- Use longer delays (15-30 seconds) between requests
- Run during off-peak hours to avoid rate limiting
- Monitor for rate limiting and adjust delays accordingly
- Consider disabling screenshots for very large batches to save time and space

### For Screenshot Capture
- Ensure adequate disk space (approximately 300-400 KB per URL)
- Use screenshots for important analyses and client deliverables
- Full HD screenshots are ideal for presentations and documentation
- Screenshots can be disabled for routine monitoring to improve speed

### For Accurate Results
- Test the same URLs multiple times for consistency
- Compare results across different time periods
- Consider geographic location differences in CDN performance
- Account for caching effects and server load variations

## 🛡️ Anti-Detection Features

- Random user agents for each browser session
- Disabled automation flags and detection bypassing
- Navigator.webdriver property masking
- Configurable request delays between URL processing
- Optimized headless browser operation
- Performance-focused Chrome settings to avoid detection
